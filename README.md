# Web-Application-with-Reactjs

* Developed a Client Side Web Application for a restaurant using React
* Used React Router, React Forms, Fetch, Client Server Communication, Redux, React Animations Redux Thunk and more

First download and install yarn. 
Then move to the project folder in the terminal and do the following to install the node modules :

yarn install --ignore-engines

Now your client application is ready. 
You can integrate it with the server side with appropriate REST API end points (Checkout "Server-side-NodeJS-Express-and-MongoDB" Repository on my account)

Start your Mongo Server and the REST API server
